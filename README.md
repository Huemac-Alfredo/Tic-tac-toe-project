# Tic-tac-toe-project
This is milestone 3 game logic; at this point all the pieces of the game were developed and assambled. We count with our main class 'Tictactoe', which can be found inside a separate file that is inside the 'lib' directory, this file is linked to the main file. We created an instance of that class, so different methods can be call on it to execute the different functions of the game.
