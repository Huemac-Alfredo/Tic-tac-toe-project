# Tic-tac-toe-project
This is milestone 3 game logic; at this point all the pieces of the game were developed and assambled. We count with our main class 'Tictactoe', which can be found inside a separate file that is
inside the 'lib' directory, this file is linked to the main file. We created an instance of that class, so different methods can be call on it to execute the different functions of the game.

## Built With
- Rubocop
- Visual Studio Code

## Live Demo

## Game instructions
- step 1: start using a Browser of your choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any other browser)

- step 2: Install: Clone the repo into your local machine

- step 3: open de main.rb file with your preffered text editor (VS Code is suggested)

- step 4: Open the "Tic-tac-toe-project" directory in the terminal (do cd Tic-tac-toe-project)
- step 5: Type bin/main.rb
- step 6: "X" plays first, so now player 1 selects a number from 1 to 9, which corresponds with the position in the board as shown:

- step 7: The next turn is for "O", player 2 selects any available position from 1 to 9. Again, it would be the turn for X.
- step 8: A player wins when the same symbol is written in a 3-position-row/column/diagonal. For example:

	 X | X | X          X |   |            X |   |   
	-----------       -------------       -------------
	   |   |              | X |            X |   |  
	-----------       -------------       -------------
	   |   |              |   | X          X |   |  

- step 9: A tied game takes place when all de positions are full and there aren't three consecutive symbols. For example:

	 X | O | X
	-----------
	 O | O | X
	-----------
	 X | X | O

- step 10: To play again, type again bin/main.rb
