# Tic-tac-toe-project
This project consisted in programming the famous Tic Tac Toe game so that users can play directly in their OS terminal. It was an assignment to us to learn how to use Ruby's OOP elements in a logic sequence.
The development of this project was distributed along 4 milestones, which are listed here:
- Setting up project resources
- Designing user interface
- Programming the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

## Built With
- Rubocop
- Visual Studio Code

## Live Demo

## Game instructions and rules
- step 1: start using a Browser of your choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any other browser)

- step 2: Install: Clone the repo into your local machine with this comand: git clone https://github.com/Huemac-Alfredo/Tic-tac-toe-project.git

- step 3: open de main.rb file with your preffered text editor (VS Code is suggested)

- step 4: Open the "Tic-tac-toe-project" directory in the terminal (do cd Tic-tac-toe-project)
- step 5: Type bin/main.rb
- step 6: The game is played only by 2 persons. They have to take turns
- step 7: "X" plays first, so now player 1 selects a number from 1 to 9, which corresponds with the position in the board as shown:

	<img src="https://github.com/Huemac-Alfredo/Tic-tac-toe-project/blob/readme_game_instructions/images/board_numbers.PNG" width="100px">

- step 8: The next turn is for "O", player 2 selects any available position from 1 to 9. Again, it would be the turn for X.
- step 9: A player wins when the same symbol is written in a 3-position-row/column/diagonal. For example:

  <img src="https://github.com/Huemac-Alfredo/Tic-tac-toe-project/blob/readme_game_instructions/images/winner_combinations.PNG" height="100px">

- step 10: A tied game takes place when all de positions are full and there aren't three consecutive symbols. For example:

  <img src="https://github.com/Huemac-Alfredo/Tic-tac-toe-project/blob/readme_game_instructions/images/tied_game_.PNG" height="110px">

- step 11: It is not allowed to select a number tha has been chosen before

- step 12: To play again, type again bin/main.rb

## Game instructions

1.- Open the "Tic-tac-toe-project" directory in the terminal
2.- Type bin/main.rb
3.- "X" plays first, so now player 1 selects a number from 1 to 9, which corresponds with the position in the board as shown:
	
	 1 | 2 | 3
	-----------
	 4 | 5 | 6
	-----------
	 7 | 8 | 9

4.- The next turn is for "O", player 2 selects any available position from 1 to 9. Again, it would be the turn for X.
5.- A player wins when the same symbol is written in a 3-position-row/column/diagonal. For example:

	 X | X | X          X |   |            X |   |   
	-----------       -------------       -------------
	   |   |              | X |            X |   |  
	-----------       -------------       -------------
	   |   |              |   | X          X |   |  

6.- A tied game takes place when all de positions are full and there aren't three consecutive symbols. For example:

	 X | O | X
	-----------
	 O | O | X
	-----------
	 X | X | O

7.- To play again, type again bin/main.rb
